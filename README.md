# Gplus: A Google+ API client library for Ruby

## Intro

The Google+ API was opened today (15th September 2011).

So far, there are two stub gems, `googleplus` and `google_plus`, both of which do literally nothing.

Lets work together to get Ruby on Google+ ASAP!

## Installation

gem install gplus

## Using the gem

To make requests, you need to [create an application](https://code.google.com/apis/console) with access to the Google+ API.

Next, [create an OAuth 2.0 client ID](http://code.google.com/apis/console#access). You'll need to pick a product name, an optional logo, and a domain to redirect to after authorization.
